        and investment dollars that everyone is more cautious with their disposable income and collecting dollars.
        Although unadvertised, we always have been willing to work with any customers on mutually agreed-upon layaway
        plans. This note is just to say if you see an item that you like but are being cautious with your collecting
        budget, feel free to ask about a confidential layaway plan. And as always thank you for your interest in our
        website and fine early Antique Pewter. We appreciate your business.
